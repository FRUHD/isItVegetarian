# Is It Vegetarian?
<p>An API which takes a user-input UPC number (those numbers under the barcode) of a store bought item and runs it through the <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org" target="_blank">Open Food Facts</a> project, returning whether an item contains non-vegetarian ingredients.</p>
<p>My plan is to use this take this sample, created through the guidance of <a href="https://github.com/Mayanwolfe" target="_blank">@MayanWolfe</a>, and make a nightshade version so I can maybe actually stick to an adjusted <a href="https://autoimmunewellness.com/what-is-aip-the-definitive-guide" target="_blank">AIP diet</a>.</p>
<p>Next steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add barcode reader</li>
  <li>Create filter for nightshades</li>
  <li>Highlight the evil (dericious) ingredients</li>
</ol>
